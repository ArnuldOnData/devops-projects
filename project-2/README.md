# README

An extremely minimal project to learn GitHub Actions 


## Sample Python project to learn GitHub Actions

This program plots sepal length vs width for very popular Iris dataset


## What is Project-2
Wanted to learn what kind of GitHub Action template I need to write to:
- access a scikit-learn dataset
- do a matplotlib plot
- save the plot as a PNG file in the repo


## How To Use Project-2
1. Fork the repo
2. clone the forked repo
3. Make an edit e.g. add a comment to sample.py or remove the PNG file. Do anything small
4. git add, commit and push
5. As soon as you push, you will  see GitHub Actions running the python program in "Actions" tab 
6. After Actions complete, you will see a new image file titled `sepal-length-vs-width.png` 
7. Workflow is in the usual place: `devops-projects/.github/workflows/project-2.yaml`
