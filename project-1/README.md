## Sample Python project to learn GitHub Actions

This program convers converts a list of temperatures from Celsium to Fahrenheit. 


## What is Project-1
Wanted to learn what kind of GitHub Action template I need to write to:
- run a python program 
- save the output to a plain text file


## How To Use Project-1
1.Fork this repo
2. Do a git pull on the repo
3. You will see a new file called "output.txt" with the output from GitHub Action workflow
4. workflow is in the usual place: `devops-projects/.github/workflows/project-1.yaml`
5. You can see the GitHub Actions running the python program in "Actions" tab (Code --> Issues --> Pull requests --> Actions)
