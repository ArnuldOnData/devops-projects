## What is Project-0
Wanted to learn what kind of GitHub Action template I need to write to:

- save the output to a plain text file


## How To Use Project-0
1. Just do a git pull on the repo
2. You will see a new file called "output.txt" with the output from GitHub Action workflow
3. workflow is in the usual place: `devops-projects/.github/workflows/project-1.yaml`
4. You can see the GitHub building the image and running the python program in "Actions" tab (Code --> Issues --> Pull requests --> Actions)
