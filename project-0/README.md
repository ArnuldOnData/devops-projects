# README

An extremely minimal project to learn GitHub Actions

## What is Project-0
Wanted to learn what kind of GitHub Action template I need to write to:
- build a docker image
- run the image (it prints some system infomration)
- save the output to a plain text file

## How To Use Project-0
1. Fork this repo
2. Just edit the sample.py file (e.g. create a new variable or print something)
3. git add and commit
4. git push
5. You will see a new file called "output.txt" with the output from GitHub Action workflow
6. workflow is in the usual place: `devops-projects/.github/workflows/project-0.yaml`
7. You can see the GitHub building the image and running the python program in "Actions" tab (Code --> Issues --> Pull requests --> Actions)
